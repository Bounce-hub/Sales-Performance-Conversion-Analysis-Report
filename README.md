## Executive Summary
Emerald Prime Properties Ltd currently records an overall sales conversion rate of 44.4%, which is below expected performance given lead volume and sales activity levels.
A detailed analysis of 225 leads across gender, inspection status, property type, and location reveals that conversion outcomes are highly dependent on who is targeted, what is sold, where the sale occurs, and whether inspections are conducted.
Key Insight
Focusing on male leads who complete inspections for residential properties increases conversion to 81.8%, nearly doubling overall performance.
What This Means for Management
•	Revenue leakage is not driven by lead shortage, but by misaligned sales focus and inconsistent execution.
•	A small number of controllable factors—inspections, lead prioritization, property focus, and location discipline, can materially improve outcomes.
Expected Impact
•	Overall conversion rate improved toward 55%+
•	Faster deal closures and reduced pending leads
•	A repeatable, data-driven sales strategy that eliminates guesswork

## Introduction

Despite consistent lead inflow, management observed:

This analysis was commissioned to provide objective, data-driven insights to support better decision-making, performance management, and revenue optimization.

## Problem Statement

Management requires clarity on:
•	Why some leads convert while others stall
•	How performance varies by location, salesperson, property type, gender, and inspection status
•	Which actions will produce the highest return on sales effort
